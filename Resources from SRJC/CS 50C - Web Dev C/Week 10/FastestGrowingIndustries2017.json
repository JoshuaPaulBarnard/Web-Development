    "description": "This industry is far and away the fastest growing in the U.S. As quoted in Forbes, Sageworks analyst James Noe said, 'There's just an obvious need in the economy for these types of services. Everyone uses computers and businesses rely heavily on technology now, so in my mind, it's a no-brainer that these types of services are growing fairly quickly.' According to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s Bureau of Labor Statistics, a 15 percent rise in employment in this field is expected from 2012 through 2022. Looks like that's on track, with 18% growth last year."
